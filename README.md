Develop classes (or structures) to work with 2D geometry:
1.	Point;
2.	Vector.
Extend them with functions for:
1.	Offset point by vector;
2.	Rotation of point about other point on specified angle (in degrees); positive direction of rotation is counter-clockwise direction.
3.	Detection of perpendicularity of two vectors.
